# MapReduceXMT v. Beta 0.1

The MapReduceXMT library ports the MapReduce framework onto the Cray XMT. MapReduce is a programming paradigm and an approach to data management for unstructured problems. It has gained relevance due to its ability to map serial operations onto parallel distributed architectures, significantly improving developer/analyst productivity. The MapReduceXMT implements the key aspects of MapReduce for the Cray XMT, a massively threaded system that is inherently difficult to program. MapReduceXMT allows users to utilize the machine effectively and efficiently without extensive training in multi-threaded programming.
